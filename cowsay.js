// The Cow Whisperer

// Challenge: create a file called cowsay.js in your Cloud9 project. 
// Running this file should output a cow saying a random fortune. 
// This is reproducing the cowsay command-line app. Make sure 
// to add/commit this file and push it to your GitHub. 
// If the fortune is longer than 30 characters, you have to wrap it 
// on a new line. For extra brownie points, wrap your fortune at 
// the word level instead of the letter level.
